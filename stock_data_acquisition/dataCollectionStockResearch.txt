This api allows us to get historical data for any stock that yahoo finance follows.
The issue is that this only gets the data about the opening, closing, high and low price for a day.
We would like to get stuff by hour too.
We know it is probably possible to do because we can go to the yahoo finance page and see the price by hour through out the day,
the one issue is that it could be against their terms of service: http://www.gummy-stuff.org/Yahoo-data.htm


data we currently get:
{'Volume': '3054930000', 'Symbol': '%5eGSPC', 'Adj_Close': '2373.469971', 'High': '2379.550049', 'Low': '2369.659912', 'Date': '2017-03-20', 'Close': '2373.469971', 'Open': '2378.23999'}
