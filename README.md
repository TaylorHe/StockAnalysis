#### About this project
You can't see it because this project was ported over from git.4sense.eu, but this project contained over 250 commits, 11 branches, and at least 5 major headaches.

Technologies used include: Python, Flask, Selenium, TextBlob, Yahoo Finance API, HTML/CSS/JS

In this project for CS 347 (Software Development Process), we focused on the best practices to develop software efficiently and with good quality. To do this, we extensively used test-driven development, agile, pair programming, and a whole bunch of other buzzwords. It worked out fairly nicely.
